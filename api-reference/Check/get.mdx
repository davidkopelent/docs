# Get Checks Endpoint

This page details the GET /checks/{merchantPlaceId}/{deskId} endpoint.

<APIRef url="../openapi/checks-api.yaml" method="get" route="/checks/{merchantPlaceId}/{deskId}" />

This will render the interactive API documentation for the "Get Checks" endpoint directly on this page, pulling all the information (parameters, request examples, response schemas) from your `checks-api.yaml` file.

**Explanation of the `<APIRef>` component:**

* `url="openapi/checks-api.yaml"`: This specifies the path to your OpenAPI specification file relative to your Mintlify project root.
* `method="get"`: This indicates that you want to display the documentation for a GET request.
* `route="/checks/{merchantPlaceId}/{deskId}"`: This is the specific path of the endpoint within your OpenAPI specification that you want to reference.

By doing this, you maintain your per-endpoint page structure in the navigation while leveraging the power of OpenAPI for detailed API documentation on each page.
